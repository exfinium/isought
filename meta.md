For the first time in my life I have a strong need to write.  Maybe so that I can better argue with myself.  Maybe so that I can speak to the world.

The intent here is to build a set of brief essays to refine my thoughts on topics that compel and confound me.  

I expect each essay to remain permanently in draft and will somehow archive each draft as I refine the work.  This because I don't expect to ever arrive at certain truth or a perfect rendering of it.  For this reason, should anyone quote my work it will serve to note the date or revision number to clarify the context of their contribution.
