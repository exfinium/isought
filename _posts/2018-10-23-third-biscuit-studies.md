### the third biscuit is immoral
credit to [Academic Agent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyawG3aTE7RmNQcFQskDWcw).  I'm not sure if he coined the phrase but it's where I first heard it.  
Though sometimes used in jest and almost always without any prescription of consequence this formulation is a resonable starting point for thinking about morality.  

### setting
For the purpose of this study I will specify some conditions for the consideration of the third biscuit sin.  This setting is not canonical and serves only to constrain this document.
* The biscuit eater is alone and there are no relevant immediate social interactions
* The biscuit is the sole property of the eater
