#### a case study of individual liberty as a pro-social ideal
### the third biscuit is immoral
Credit to [Academic Agent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyawG3aTE7RmNQcFQskDWcw).  I'm not sure if he coined the phrase but he's where I first heard it.  

Though sometimes used in jest and almost always without any prescription of consequence this formulation is a nice starting point for thinking about morality.  

### setting
Some preconditions to narrow the topic.  The setting is not canonical and serves only to constrain this document.  
* The biscuit eater is alone. Sharing is not a relevant concern.  
* The biscuit is the sole property of the eater.  
* The eater is at home and can prepare a healthy meal.  

### the sin
The implication is that the first and second biscuits are a harmless private indulgence, but the third biscuit is a slightly excessive indulgence.  Why is excessive indulgence immoral?  I can only think of two direct consequences.  
*	Excessive eating, especially of sweets, leads to obesity and ill health.  
*	Failure to restrain from self-harm or depriving one’s self of a future indulgence both indicate a lack of self discipline.  
In both cases the consequence is **failure to be one’s best self**.  How is this immoral?  

### social and individual
Some argue that morality has no basis without a social context.  On these terms what is the social harm of failure to be one’s best self?  It can only be that **society has a moral claim on the individual** and by failing to achieve their potential the individual is withholding from society its rightful share of the individual’s production. Further, a needlessly unhealthy person might make an unfair claim on society in the form of increased demand for public health care and accommodations for obesity as a disability.    

The individual morality claim would be that **the individual has a moral obligation to themselves** to be their best self, to live the most lively and meaningful life they can achieve.  Though lacking a social founding, this idea is not anti-social, rather in practice it is inevitably pro-social.

### appropriate punishment

Whether the sin is social or individual in nature an occasional mild scolding is warranted, varying only in the intent.  The social scold implies a demand for the scoldee to give society more.  The individual scold implies a wish for the scoldee to have a better life.  The implication perceived by the scoldee is likely to be derived from their own understanding of morality.

Put down that third biscuit because by doing so:  

  *the world will be a better place and you owe that.*  
or  
  *you will have a better life, of which you will be more deserving.*  

### the greater good

A world that places ideals above individuals will become filled with individuals less able to approach any ideal.
