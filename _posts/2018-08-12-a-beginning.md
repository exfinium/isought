I have no plans to rush.  The basics are in place for now. I will post brain farts as thay come to me and once a topic jumps out as a stayer it will appear as a dedicated document.

I'm listening to [FRIENDED VS GARY EDWARDS ON "METAPHORICAL TRUTH"](https://youtu.be/SzMd1LAgBSk) and jotting thoughts.

Truth is good :: I think that's an unprovable truth.

Man is perfectable/eternaly flawed. :: maybe man is improvable?  Reminded of Firefly/Serenity cultural engineering.

Protestant "anyone can function as their own priest" >> enlightenment >> gender fluid :: maybe partially

Truth = factual truth, scientific truth :: emperical truth is the only real truth?  I disagree

There are values and beleifs :: Maybe "knowing" deserves to stand as a useful subset of beleif.

Ethics are communal ::  what are Robinson Crusoe's ethics?

Truth != value/axiom :: motivated reasoning makes the desirable seem true

You respect truth, you don't appreciate truth, truth is sacred, fearsome :: truth as an immovable object / unstoppable force  <<<

"I feel thirsty" is true if the person saying it is thirsty. :: unprovable, unfalsifyable - seems wrong that it's the same word that's used in the previos entry.
