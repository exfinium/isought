## What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

### what
#### choice >> options >> knowledge
The question is faulty if *choice* is an illusion.  Every other word in the question is meaningless without choice.  If there is choice there must be options.  The provision of options requires some knowledge of *what is*.  Higher quality knowledge will lead to higher quality answers.

### should
#### ought >> good >> truth >> wisdom
The concept of ought assumes a hierarchy of *what is good* and an ability to move towards it.  An ought asserts a true path towards the good.  Accumulation of the truest oughts is the nature of wisdom.

### I
#### self >> other >> group
In the space of knowledge, choice and action, the conscious individual is irrevocably the exclusive final arbiter of voluntary action and is the only one in possession of all the information and circumstance that precedes choice and action.  
'What should *you* do?' is a question that allows only a fraction of the information available to the *I* and can be expected to deliver statistically inferior answers.  
'What should *we* do?' is really just an aggregate of the *I* question, albeit with complex feedback into individual volition.

### do
#### action >> care >> expectation >> consequence >> integration
Voluntary action is a normal continual state of every conscious person. A flowing web of experience and intent is constantly being actualized with varying degrees of care. Careful action warrants mindful expectation and careful observation of consequence. Comparing expectation to consequence brings integration of reality into one's network of knowledge and truth.

### Why this question?
Of all the questions that could be asked, this question is implicitly being asked and answered every waking moment by all of us.  Every other question only exists in the constant presence of this question, and the way this question is asked and answered influences our treatment of every other question.
