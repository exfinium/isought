### What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

## what  
The choice.
The question is faulty if choice is an illusion.  Every other word in the question is meaningless without choice.  If there is choice there must be options.

## should
The ought.  

## I
The self.

## do
The action.
