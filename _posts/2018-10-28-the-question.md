## What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

### what  
#### choice, options, knowledge, and truth
The question is faulty if choice is an illusion.  Every other word in the question is meaningless without choice.  If there is choice there must be options.  Knowledge of the options is neccesary for a useful answer. 

### should
The ought. The good.

### I
The self.

### do
The action.
