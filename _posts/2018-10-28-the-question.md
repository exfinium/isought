## What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

### what
#### choice >> options >> knowledge
The question is faulty if *choice* is an illusion.  Every other word in the question is meaningless without choice.  If there is choice there must be options.  The provision of options requires some knowledge of *what is*.  Higher quality knowledge will lead to higher quality answers.

### should
#### ought >> good >> truth >> wisdom
The concept of ought assumes a heirarchy of *what is good* and an ability to move towards it.  An ought asserts a true path towards the good.  Accumulation of the truest oughts is the nature of wisdom.

### I
The self.

### do
The action.
