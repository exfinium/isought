## What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

### what
**choice >> options >> knowledge**  
The foundation of this question is *choice*.  We choose from rank orderable *options* in lists drawn from our own *knowledge*.

### should
**ought >> good >> truth >> wisdom**  
The concept of ought assumes a hierarchy of *what is good* and an ability to move towards it.  An ought asserts a true path towards the good.  Accumulation of the truest oughts is the nature of wisdom.

### I
**self >> other >> group**  
In the space of knowledge, choice and action, the conscious individual *self* is irrevocably the exclusive final arbiter of voluntary action and is the only one in possession of all the information and circumstance that precedes choice and action.  
'What should *you* do?' is a question that only allows consideration of information available to the *other* and can be expected to deliver statistically inferior answers.  
'What should *we* do?' is really just the *self* and *other* questions aggregated across the *group*, albeit with complex feedback into individual volition.

### do
**action >> care >> expectation >> consequence >> integration**  
Voluntary *action* is a normal continual state of every conscious person. A flowing web of experience and intent is constantly being actualized with varying degrees of *care*. Careful action warrants mindful *expectation* and careful observation of *consequence*. Comparing expectation to consequence brings *integration* of reality into one's network of knowledge and truth.

### Why this question?
Of all the questions that could be asked, this question is implicitly being asked and answered every waking moment by all of us.  Every other question only exists in the constant presence of this question, and the way this question is asked and answered influences our treatment of every other question.  This question is the bridge between potential and actual, between intent and purpose, between sentiment and character. Mindful consideration of this question offers more leverage for improving our lives than any other.

### What presumptions are necessary?
