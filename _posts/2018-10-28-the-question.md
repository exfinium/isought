## What should I do?
Why is this *the* question? What are the presumptions of the question? How can the question be answered?

### what  
#### choice >> options >> knowledge >> truth >> wisdom
The question is faulty if choice is an illusion.  Every other word in the question is meaningless without choice.  If there is choice there must be options.  Some knowledge of the options is neccessary to answer the question.  Higher quality knowledge will allow a higher quality answer.

### should
The ought. The good.

### I
The self.

### do
The action.
