reality, existence, the universe, eveything, anything  
• material: that which exists whether or not we experience it

• conceptual: that which exists as a conscious abstraction  
• societal: that which exists as a communal concept  


### what is true
• an audacious attempt at a universal definition of truth  
• truth is a (fundamental?) property of a concept

• certainty is a (fundamental?) property of truth  
• [Anekantavada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada) we know only in part  
• the significance of the unchangeable past and the uncertain future

• an irresponsible attempt at unification of morality  
• maybe just exploring any relationship between truth and morality
