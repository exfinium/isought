### what is
  reality, existence, the universe, eveything, anything
  * material: that which exists whether or not we experience it
  * experiential: that which is real only to the mind having the experience
  * conceptual: that which exists as a conscious abstraction
  * societal: that which exists as a communal map of a concept
  
#### what is not

### what is true
  an audacious attempt at a universal definition of truth
  truth is a (fundamental?) property of a concept

### what is certain
  it's probably possible that absolute certainties are common but it's probably not possible to know for certain any of them
  certainty is a (fundamental?) property of truth
  
### what was and what will be
  the significance of the unchangeable past and the uncertain future
  
### what ought
  an irresponsible attempt at unification of morality  
  maybe just exploring any relationship between truth and morality
