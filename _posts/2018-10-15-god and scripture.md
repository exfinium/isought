### priors
* religion has utility, god is a useful meta concept
* the author was educated in christianity 
* religious texts, especially ancient ones, contain significant wisdom
* the bible is fallible and partially faulty, possibly greatly so
* magical thinking is unproductive in the pursuit of wisdom
* a rational, grounded, optimistic reading of the bible is warranted
* altruism is a disfunctional moral foundation
* obligation to be a good steward of one's self is a better primary moral

### premises
* existence exists and is material reality
* god is the identity of the entirety of existence ("I AM that I AM")
* whether god exists as a conscious self can't be proved or disproved
* the nature of god can only be known by experience of material reality

### method
* anthropomorphize god only to aid a thought experiment or heuristic
* de-anthropomorphize god's behaviour to mere actualizations of reality
* attempt to interpret bible passages literally and categorize 
  * apparent statement of fact, consistent with reality
  * apparent statement of fact, unprovable
  * apparent statement of fact, inconsistent with reality
  * apparent myth / parable  

### selections
The commandments:  

>Though shalt value no other ideas higher than reality itself.  
>Though shalt not make a map or image of any idea and surrender your faculties in service of it.  Reality is inescapable and will not be ignored.  
>Reality will bring suffering for several generations after them that hate reality.  
>Goodness for the great many will be found by those that love reality and heed its lessons.  
>Though shalt carry the concept of actual reality with gravity.  Empty acknowledgement of reality will not save you from real consequences.
