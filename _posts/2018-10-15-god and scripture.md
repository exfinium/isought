god and scripture

### priors
* religion has utility, god is a useful meta concept
* the author was educated in christianity 
* religious texts, especially ancient ones, contain significant wisdom
* the bible is fallible and partially faulty, possibly greatly so
* magical thinking is unproductive in the pursuit of wisdom
* a rational, grounded, optimistic reading of the bible

### premises
* existence exists and is material reality
* define God as the entirety of existence (I AM that I AM)
* Whether God exists as a conscious self can't be proved or disproved
* make no claim about God except that which can be experienced in material reality
* represent God as a person only to aid a thought experiment or heuristic
*
