### priors
* religion has utility, god is a useful meta concept
* the author was educated in christianity 
* religious texts, especially ancient ones, contain significant wisdom
* the bible is fallible and partially faulty, possibly greatly so
* magical thinking is unproductive in the pursuit of wisdom
* a rational, grounded, optimistic reading of the bible is warranted
* altruism is a disfunctional moral foundation
* obligation to be a good steward of one's self is a better primary moral

### premises
* existence exists and is material reality
* god is the identity of the entirety of existence ("I AM that I AM")
* whether god exists as a conscious self can't be proved or disproved
* the nature of god can only be known by experience of material reality

### method
* anthropomorphize god only to aid a thought experiment or heuristic
* de-anthropomorphize god's behaviour to mere actualizations of reality
* attempt to interpret bible passages literally and categorize 
  * apparent statement of fact, consistent with reality
  * apparent statement of fact, unprovable
  * apparent statement of fact, inconsistent with reality
  * apparent myth / parable  

### selections
The commandments:  

>Though shalt value no other ideas above reality itself.  
>Though shalt not make a model, map or image of any idea and surrender your faculties in service of it.  Reality is unrelenting and will not be ignored. It will bring suffering for several generations after them that detest reality.  Goodness for the great many will be found by those that love reality and heed its lessons.  
>Though shalt carry the concept of actual reality with gravity.  Cursory consideration of reality will not save you from real consequences.  Reality rewards diligent attention and deliberate rational thoughtfulness.
