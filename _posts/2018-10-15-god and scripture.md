### priors
* religion has utility, god is a useful meta concept
* the author was educated in christianity 
* religious texts, especially ancient ones, contain significant wisdom
* the bible is fallible and partially faulty, possibly greatly so
* magical thinking is unproductive in the pursuit of wisdom
* a rational, grounded, optimistic reading of the bible is warranted
* altruism is a disfunctional moral foundation
* obligation to be a good steward of one's self is a better primary moral

### premises
* existence exists and is material reality
* god is the identity of the entirety of existence ("I AM that I AM")
* whether god exists as a conscious self can't be proved or disproved
* the nature of god can only be known by experience of material reality

### method
* anthropomorphize god only to aid a thought experiment or heuristic
* de-anthropomorphize god's behaviour to mere actualizations of reality
* attempt to interpret bible passages literally and categorize 
  * apparent statement of fact, consistent with reality
  * apparent statement of fact, unprovable
  * apparent statement of fact, inconsistent with reality
  * apparent myth / parable  

### selections
the first few commandments:  
(KJV) Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  

>Though shalt value no other ideas higher than reality itself.  
>Though shalt not make a map or image of any idea and surrender your faculties in service of it.  Because reality is inescapable and will not be ignored.  
>Reality will bring suffering for several generations after them that hate reality.  
>Goodness for the great many will be found by those that love reality and heed its lessons.
