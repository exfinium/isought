### priors
* religion has utility, god is a useful meta concept
* the author was educated in christianity 
* religious texts, especially ancient ones, contain significant wisdom
* the bible is fallible and partially faulty, possibly greatly so
* magical thinking is unproductive in the pursuit of wisdom
* a rational, grounded, optimistic reading of the bible is warranted

### premises
* existence exists and is material reality
* god is the identity of the entirety of existence ("I AM that I AM")
* whether god exists as a conscious self can't be proved or disproved
* the nature of god can only be known by:
  * experience of material reality
  * rational evaluation of evidence
  * truthful discussion of ideas

### the commandments
* Though shalt value no other ideas above reality itself.  
* Though shalt not make a model, map or image of any idea (real or imaginary) and surrender your faculties in service of it.  Reality is unrelenting and will not be ignored. It will bring suffering for several generations after them that detest reality.  But goodness for the great many will be found by those that love reality and heed its lessons.  
* Though shalt carry the concept of actual reality with gravity.  Cursory consideration of reality will not save you from real consequences.  Reality rewards diligent attention and deliberate rational thoughtfulness.
